This a project build using pygame which helps the user visualize the working process of A* pathfinding algorithm


// How to run the code 

To run this code you need to have python and pygame installed in your pc.

After installing the required modules run the code using python 
A grid window will appear on your screen 
Select the starting point on the grid 
Then select the ending point of your own choice 
Now draw lines creating obstacles between the start and the endpoint just like a maze
After you finish drawing all the obstacles you need to press the spacebar to start the algorithm
You can now see on the screen how the algorithm works and also the short path from start to end
